# Autonomous-Vehicle-Steering-using-YOLO-4
This project implements YOLO 3/4/5 to identify and track the position of orange and blue cone markers present on either sides of a track on which the car has to move. A miniature car is 3D printed and assembled to test the program in real life. A camera is mounted on the hood of the car to capture live video footage of the track. This data is sent to Jetson Nano attached at the back of the car which runs the program and sends the steering instructions to a servo motor connected to the front axle of the car allow it to steer.
